```{r libraries, include=FALSE}
library(bayesdfa)

df <- read.csv()
```

## Climate Metrics data set

```{r df}
df <- read.csv()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
